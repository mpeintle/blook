<p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg leading-8">
	I'm a future civil engineer studying at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville. Tennessee was the
	last place I thought I would ever go to college - partly because my family and I were living on
	the other side of the planet, in Hungary. Once my parents were given the opportunity to move here
	and work at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, they both agreed to stay. Coming from a different
	culture was difficult but I'm grateful for the opportunities I received and I carry that
	open-mindedness with me everywhere. My academic interests are physics, programming, and design,
	although I am also interested in photography. It's hard to name just one subject, if it is
	centered on creating, I will probably love it. Outside of the classroom, you'll find me mountain
	biking, hanging out with friends, or building something new. I also enjoy hiking!
